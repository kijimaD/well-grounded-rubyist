# Most of class can be instantiated using new.
str = String.new
arr = Array.new

# Some can't. you can't create a new instance of the class Integer.

# Literal constructors
# String -> "new string"
# Symbol -> :symbol
# Array -> [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# Hash -> { "New York" => "NY" }
# Range -> 0..9
# Regexp -> /([a-z]+)/
# Proc(lambda) â†’ ->(x, y { x * y }


# Literal constructor characters with more than one meaning...
# ex. curly braces... Codeblock + Hash
